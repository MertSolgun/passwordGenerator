<h1>Features</h1>


* Include Uppercase Letters: Users can choose to include uppercase letters (A-Z) in their passwords, adding an extra layer of complexity and strength.
* Include Lowercase Letters: The generator also allows the inclusion of lowercase letters (a-z), which is essential for a robust password.
* Include Numbers: For additional security, users can opt to include numbers (0-9) in their passwords.
* Include Symbols: To further enhance the password's complexity, the tool provides an option to include special characters and symbols (e.g., @, #, $, etc.).
* Adjustable Length: The password length can be easily adjusted using a range slider. This feature enables users to specify exactly how long they want their password to be.
* Strength Indicator: Based on the selected criteria and the length of the password, the generator displays a strength indicator. This indicator categorizes the password strength into three levels:
* Too Weak: This level indicates that the password is not sufficiently secure and could be easily compromised.
* Medium: A medium level suggests a reasonably strong password but with room for improvement.
* Difficult: This level signifies that the password is highly secure and robust.
